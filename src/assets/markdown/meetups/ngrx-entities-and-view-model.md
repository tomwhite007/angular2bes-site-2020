- Post-lockdown Angular jobs and contract market, and how we can help

### NgRx Entities

Better than arrays!

- Designed for keeping tabular records
- Designed for reducing boilerplate and bug opportunity
- Designed to provide all common table functions via a adapter functions
- Has concept for fixed sort order
- Has concept for selected record

A quick study (2-3hrs):
[Angular University: Angular NgRx Entity - Complete Practical Guide](blog.angular-university.io/ngrx-entity)

#### An example Record Interface

```javascript
interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
}
```

#### Example Entity State

based on the Book record interface

```javascript
{
  books: {
    ids: [
      'one',
      'two',
      'three'
    ],
    entities: {
      one: {
        id: 'one',
        title: 'A book title'
      },
      two: {
        id: 'two',
        title: 'Another book title'
      },
      three: {
        id: 'three',
        title: 'A classic book title'
      }
    },
    loaded: true,
    selectedId: 'three'
  }
}
```
