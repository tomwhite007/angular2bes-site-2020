### Your Angular Study Plan

Here's a link to [Tom and Stephen's repo](https://github.com/Angular-community-collab/angular-study-guide#readme)

This repo will be moving to Angular Nation's Github Group shortly.

Here's a link to [Angular Nation](AngularNation.net). You can contact us to get an invite and come in.

Topics and materials suggestions for the Study Plan from the chat:

- There are free courses on Angular Nation (RxJs, Performance, CLI Schematics, and Reactive Forms)
- Another good area to concentrate on would also be on http requests (api) As well as how to connect/install/develop with 3rd party libraries and CSS libraries
- Deployment / serving via nginx or nodejs etc
- Angular CLI

### How to Style your App

Here's a link to [Chris's repo](https://github.com/richgenres/style-your-app)

Here's a link to [Chris's slide deck](https://github.com/tomwhite007/angular2bes-site-2020/raw/master/apps/angular2bes/src/assets/content/how-to-style-your-app.pdf). It lists all the steps he recommends for his strategy to style and app.

Comments from the chat:

- Naming convention is everything
- What do you think about frameworks like tailwindcss and tachyons?
- May I ask what you think about "CSS in ts" method? I follow a meetup some time ago, where the speaker used a library that helps (intellisense, etc...) and the main advantage was that this allows the developer to set values dynamically with ifs
- Firefox is best css inspector
- You can use `[ngClass.className]="condition"`
- I think I'll need a session for that too someday, if Chris has time
